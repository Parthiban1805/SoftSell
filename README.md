SoftSell – Software License Resale Landing Page
SoftSell is a fictional single-page marketing website designed for a startup that helps people sell unused software licenses. The site is built using React and Tailwind CSS and is fully responsive with a clean, modern interface. It’s hosted live at: [your live site URL here].

Features Implemented
A hero section with a clear headline, short subheading, and a strong call-to-action button.

A "How It Works" section showing three simple steps to sell a license: Upload License → Get Valuation → Get Paid, each with an icon.

A "Why Choose Us" section highlighting four benefits of using SoftSell (secure transactions, fast payouts, transparent valuation, and 24/7 support).

Two customer testimonials to build trust.

A fully functional contact form with fields for name, email, company, license type (dropdown), and message. Includes basic front-end validation.

Bonus Features
A light and dark mode toggle for better accessibility and user preference.

SEO meta tags and a meaningful page title for better discoverability.

Placeholder favicon and logo to make the site feel more real.

Smooth animations using Framer Motion to enhance the user experience.

A basic chat widget that responds to hardcoded example questions like "How do I sell my license?"

Design Choices
I chose Tailwind CSS to speed up styling and maintain a clean, responsive layout. The color scheme is simple and professional to suit a B2B tech product. Components are modular, making the site easy to maintain and update. I focused on clear navigation and visual hierarchy to guide users from understanding the service to taking action.

Time Spent
Planning and UI design took around  20mins.
Building and testing the main sections took about 1 hr.
Bonus features and responsiveness adjustments took another  30 mins.
In total, I spent roughly  2 hours on this project.
